### Step 1) Get Your Local Environment setup

Clone this repo locally, and make sure all your team members have access to it.

* Install the latest [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org).

* `git clone git@github.com:rumblex/WilsonReddy/snaide.git`

* `cd angularattack2016-snaide`

* `npm install`

* `npm start` will start the server locally to test that everything is running correctly


### Step 2) Deploy Your App

While you can't make any checkins before the comp, what you **can** do right now is deploy this sample app to [Surge](https://surge.sh) (our competition hosting provider).

* `npm install -g surge`

* `surge .`

Note: please do not remove the `CNAME` file, as that tells it where to deploy to.

If you receive an error message `"You do not have permission to publish to snaide.2016.angularattack.io"`, it might mean another team member has already deployed your project to Surge. Ask them to run the next step to give you access.

### Step 3) Add Your Team Members to Surge

* `surge . --add omarvillavicencio@hotmail.com,robinliu@microsoft.com,v-lapedd@microsoft.com,wilg@microsoft.com`


### Step 4) Wait til we start accepting pull requests

we will announce date soon...
